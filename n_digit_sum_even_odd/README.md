## Problem

Given an integer N, print all N-digit numbers with sum of digits at Even index equal to sum of digits at Odd index.

### For example
```
Input : N = 2

Output : 11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 99

Explanation : 

All these elements have sum at their odd indexes and sum at their even indexes equal.

11
sum at odd indexes = element at 1st index = 1
sum at even indexes = element at 0th index = 1

Similarly, all other elements 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, and 99.
```
